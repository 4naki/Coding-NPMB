First what you want to do is to spawn a chair, the skeleton base e2 and the actual base e2, npmb v1.0 by naki

spawn a pod controller and a cam controller

cam settings below:

local coordinates: uncheck
client side movement: check
free movement: uncheck
cl movement local to parent: uncheck
client side zooming: uncheck
auto unclip: uncheck
draw player: uncheck
draw parent: check

Wire options:

From Cam Controller:
Activated to pod controller active
Position to Base E2 CamPos
Distance to Base E2 CamDist
Parent to seat

From Base E2:
Seat to seat
EyeAng to cam controller CamAng
Boost to pod controller shift
Base to a base plate spawned on ground, the mech spawns on it and works as a respawnpoint when you reload the e2
MWUp to pod controller PrevWeapon
MWDown to pod controller NextWeapon

From Pod Controller:
Crosshairs and hide player to active

From Skeleton Base E2:
Seat to seat
HitPos to cam controller HitPos
Boost to pod controller shift
Fly to Base E2 Fly
RSegA,B,C and Foot goes to right ik leg e2's representive outputs if you have the edited e2 of shadowscion, those options are listed in the other readme file
same for LSegA,B,C and Foot

From Model Base E2:
Base to seat and everything else except leg parts go to the Skeleton Base E2

From Weaponizer:
R and L _hand goes to the Skeleton Base E2

GunR and L goes to the weapons that you want to use

From IK Leg E2s
right side Target to RPos in Base E2
left side Target to LPos in Base E2

#End of wiring

if you have everything wired, what you want to do is to move the leg e2s next to the seat above the locations where the leg joints start, this way they won't hit the rangers if they were to hit entities, 
multiparent them to the seat

now if you have done everything correctly, you can now open the base e2 and go to line
15 and change the ReadyToUse=0 to ReadyToUse=1

also when copying the mech copy the whole mech before changing this value, just to be sure that it won't break

even tho this setup is quite long, it still is worth it, this base works as a gundam base or armored core base

until i update the e2s do not hit a wall, it breaks the mech momentarely, to fix this grab the seat with physics gun and freeze it, then unfreeze it againg
